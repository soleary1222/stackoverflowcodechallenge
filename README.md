Dev Code Challenge of Challenging Coding

# Overall Goal

Create a web page that displays a list of recent StackOverflow questions that have an accepted answer and
contain more than 1 answer. Allow visitors to view all the answers for a selected question in a random order
and try to guess which answer was the accepted answer.
We expect this to take about 3-5 hours. Please send us whatever you have completed after 1 week. You do
not need to have all requirements completed.
Stackoverflow API
[https://api.stackexchange.com/docs](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs)

# Requirements

1. Use the StackOverflow API to pull and display a list of recent questions that have an accepted answer
and more than 1 answer
2. Select a question to view all the answers for that question in a random order
3. Allow visitors to guess which answer they think is the “accepted” answer.
4. After guessing, display if the user guessed the “accepted” answer
Upload your solution to a public git repository and send us the link.
Bonus: Use git from the beginning to have a full commit history
Extra Bonus: Send us a link to a live version of your solution. For example, create a free Azure account and
host it as a free website.
## Things to note
- The StackExchange API is rate limited and will shut you off after a certain amount of requests in a time
period. (Hint: look at "quota_remaining” in the request) We don’t need this to be handled - but just be
aware of it.
- Implement this as a website in any programming language you want but must have instructions on how
to run locally
- You can use any libraries, starter projects, and frameworks to help you along, but you must display the
desired requirements above.
- Visual design will not be judged, but we do expect clean, semantic markup, well organized CSS (if any),
and a relatively intuitive user experience
